###What is system resiliency

Basically, a system is resilient if it continues to carry out its mission in the face of adversity (i.e., if it provides required capabilities despite excessive stresses that can cause disruptions). Being resilient is important because no matter how well a system is engineered, reality will sooner or later conspire to disrupt the system. Residual defects in the software or hardware will eventually cause the system to fail to correctly perform a required function or cause it to fail to meet one or more of its quality requirements (e.g., availability, capacity, interoperability, performance, reliability, robustness, safety, security, and usability). The lack or failure of a safeguard will enable an accident to occur. An unknown or uncorrected security vulnerability will enable an attacker to compromise the system. An external environmental condition (e.g., loss of electrical supply or excessive temperature) will disrupt service.

Due to these inevitable disruptions, availability and reliability by themselves are insufficient, and thus a system must also be resilient. It must resist adversity and provide continuity of service, possibly under a degraded mode of operation, despite disturbances due to adverse events and conditions. It must also recover rapidly from any harm that those disruptions might have caused. As in the old Timex commercial, a resilient system "can take a licking and keep on ticking."

However, system resilience is more complex than the preceding explanation implies. System resilience is not a simple Boolean function (i.e., a system is not merely resilient or not resilient). No system is 100 percent resilient to all adverse events or conditions. Resilience is always a matter of degree. System resilience is typically not measurable on a single ordinal scale. In other words, it might not make sense to say that system A is more resilient than system B.

To fully understand resilience, it must be decomposed into its component parts. To exhibit resilience, a system must incorporate controls that detect adverse events and conditions, respond appropriately to these disturbances, and rapidly recover afterward. Because resilience assumes that adverse events and conditions will occur, controls that prevent adversities are outside of the scope of resilience.

Some resilience controls support detection, while other controls support response or recovery. A system may therefore be resilient in some ways, but not in others. System A might be the most resilient in terms of detecting certain adverse events, whereas system B might be the most resilient in terms of responding to other adverse events. Conversely, system C might be the most resilient in terms of recovering from a specific type of harm caused by certain adverse events.

It is important to understand the scope of what it means for a system to resist adversity:

- What critical capabilities/services must the system continue to provide despite disruptions?
- What types of adversities can disrupt the delivery of these critical capabilities (i.e., what adverse events and conditions must the system be able to tolerate)?
- What are the types and levels of harm to what assets that can cause these disruptions?

The preceding points lead to a more detailed and nuanced definition of system resilience:

A system is resilient to the degree to which it rapidly and effectively protects its critical capabilities from disruption caused by adverse events and conditions.

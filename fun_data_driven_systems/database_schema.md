### What is a database schema?

A database schema represents the logical configuration
of all or part of a relational database. It can exist both as a visual
representation and as a set of formulas known as integrity constraints that govern a database.
These formulas are expressed in a data definition language,
such as SQL. As part of a data dictionary,
a database schema indicates how the entities that make up the database relate to
one another, including tables, views, stored procedures, and more.

Typically, a database designer creates a database schema
to help programmers whose software will interact with the database.
The process of creating a database schema is called data modeling.
When following the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-schema_approach">three-schema approach</a> to database design,
this step would follow the creation of a conceptual schema. 
Conceptual schemas focus on an organizationâ€™s
informational needs rather than the structure of a database.There are two main kinds of database schema:
1. A logical database schema conveys the logical constraints that apply to the stored data. 
It may define integrity constraints, views, and tables.
2. physical database schema lays out how data is stored physically on a storage system in terms of files and indices.

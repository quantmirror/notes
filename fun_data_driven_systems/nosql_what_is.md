### What is NoSQL

NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. 
NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. 
They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

When people use the term “NoSQL database”, they typically use it to refer to any non-relational database.
Some say the term “NoSQL” stands for “non SQL” while others say it stands for “not only SQL.” Either way,
most agree that NoSQL databases are databases that store data in a format other than relational tables.
<br>
A common misconception is that NoSQL databases or non-relational databases don’t store relationship data well.
NoSQL databases can store relationship data—they just store it differently than relational databases do.
In fact, when compared with SQL databases, many find modeling relationship data in NoSQL databases to be easier than in SQL databases,
because related data doesn’t have to be split between tables.
<br>
NoSQL data models allow related data to be nested within a single data structure (Hierarchical Data model).
<br>
NoSQL databases emerged in the late 2000s as the cost of storage dramatically decreased. 
Gone were the days of needing to create a complex, difficult-to-manage data model simply for the purposes of reducing data duplication. 
Developers (rather than storage) were becoming the primary cost of software development, so NoSQL databases optimized for developer productivity.
